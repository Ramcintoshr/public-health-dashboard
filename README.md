# Public Health Outcomes Dashboard (Simulated)

This project simulates work I conducted at the Urban Education Research Center (UERC), where I analyzed equity-focused education data to support public health and policy discussions. This sample recreates the structure of dashboards and data cleaning workflows I contributed to, using publicly available formats.

## Tools Used
- R (data wrangling and plotting)
- Tableau (simulated dashboards)
- Excel (mock data)
- Public third-party datasets

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare multi-source public datasets
- Create visual summaries of outcome disparities by region, program type, and demographic group
- Build dashboards for both internal and external stakeholder use
- Communicate insights to academic and policy audiences

## Whatâ€™s Included
- `public_health_summary.R`: Example R script for loading, cleaning, and visualizing a simulated dataset
- (Optional) Screenshot of Tableau dashboard [coming soon]

## Note
All data and code here are fully simulated and created solely for demonstration purposes.
